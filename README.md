## Introduction

BlockSocial is a unique social media platform that revolutionizes the way users interact with algorithms and data processing. Unlike traditional social media platforms, BlockSocial allows users to choose a provider, which is an algorithm creator, to curate their personalized feed. Providers offer algorithms that shape the user experience, and users are compensated with monthly crypto payments based on their data contributions. Additionally, BlockSocial provides users with the ability to create and sell NFTs from their posts within the platform.

This README will guide you through the key features and components of BlockSocial, both from the user and provider perspectives.

## User Side

### Signing Up

To join BlockSocial, users can sign up through the official website (https://blocksocial.vercel.app) by providing their basic information. During the sign-up process, users will have the option to choose a provider.

### Choosing a Provider

A provider on BlockSocial is an algorithm creator who designs personalized feed experiences for users. Upon sign-up, users can browse through the list of available providers and select the one that aligns with their preferences. Users can change their provider selection on a monthly basis.

### Main Feed

Once a provider is chosen, users' main feed will be curated based on the selected provider's algorithm. The main feed will display personalized posts, advertisements, and other relevant content. BlockSocial ensures that all data processing occurs internally on their (BlockSocial) servers, maintaining user privacy and anonymity.

### Monthly Payments

As users engage with BlockSocial and contribute data through their interactions, they are rewarded with monthly crypto payments. These payments are based on the user's data contributions and serve as a token of appreciation for their participation in the platform.

### Rating Providers

Users have the ability to rate and provide feedback on the performance of their chosen providers. This feedback helps other users make informed decisions when selecting their providers. The rating system promotes a healthy provider ecosystem and encourages providers to improve their algorithms.

### Creating and Selling NFTs

BlockSocial empowers users to convert their posts into non-fungible tokens (NFTs) free of charge. Users can create unique digital assets from their posts and sell them within the platform. This feature enables users to explore new avenues of monetization and engage with the growing NFT market.

## Provider Side

### Participating as a Provider

Data analysts, algorithm creators, or anyone interested in becoming a provider can participate in the BlockSocial ecosystem. By joining as a provider, individuals can contribute their algorithmic expertise and offer personalized experiences to users.

### Algorithm Submission

To become a provider, individuals must submit their algorithm code written in a programming language such as Python, C++, or any other supported language. The algorithm determines how the user's feed will be curated and presented. Providers should ensure that their algorithms meet BlockSocial's guidelines and are optimized for performance.

### Choosing an Offer Amount

Providers must specify an offer amount that represents the monthly payment they are willing to provide to users who choose their algorithm. This amount serves as a compensation for user data contributions. Providers can generate revenue by displaying advertisements or leveraging user data (anonymously) for third-party purposes. It's important to note that providers never have direct access to user data; all data processing occurs within BlockSocial's internal servers.

### Monetization

BlockSocial offers various avenues for providers to monetize their participation. Providers can earn revenue through ad placements within users' feeds or by leveraging user data (anonymously) for third-party collaborations. BlockSocial provides a secure and transparent environment for providers to monetize their algorithmic contributions while ensuring user privacy.
